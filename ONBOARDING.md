# Onboarding

## Tools

### Messaging

Slack is used primarily for messaging. Here's list of channels you make sure you subsrcibe to
* hippokampoiers - primary channel for team communication, pull request reviews and general team chat
* squad-object-standup - channel where a standup bot posts a daily summary of standup info collected from everyone on the team
* sf-office-room - channel for all employees working in the SF office
* developers - channel geared towards engineers with everyone posting articles on anything related to engineering/engineers
* general - everyone is here, general announcements are usually made here
* ts-topic-zenko - where support requests for zenko requesting engineering help are made
* ts-topic-s3 - where support requests for S3 Connector are made, typically responded by TS but Engineering is requested for help
    from time to time
* ts-topic-k8s - support requests for MetalK8s product
* zenko-topics - queries from Sales on feature requests
* account-<customer> - these are dedicated channels for TS/Sales to discuss customer installs, upgrades, pocs, issues etc.
* global-support - channel used by Global Support team to triage issues

Tips:
* Scality encourages transparency and open communication. It's recommnend to converse in channels rather than DMs, with exceptions for 1:1 conversations when needed
* Anyone can join any channel

### Email

Gmail is the default client. You can setup any client you would like that fits you like Outlook, Thunderbird, OSX Mail etc.

Email groups that you are typically part of
* team.store - This is equivalent to all, it reaches everyone in the company
* object-squad - Team's mail group
* sf-engineering - Old group for SF engineering, it's still used sometimes
* eng-all - All engineering teams combined, Paris and SF
* team.sf - Everyone in the SF office

### Repos

All repositories that Object Squad contributes to are hosted in Github. The squad does not work on Bitbucket but from time to time
depending on the issue we may have to review changes on Bitbucket projects for TS Knowledge base articles, Tech Bulletins, S3C documentation etc.

### Calendar

All calendar events can be seen on Google Calendar. The most interesting ones to subscribe to are
Work From Home and SF Office Events

### Documents trove

Google Drive

### Conferencing

Google Meet - This is most used for all conferencing
Slack - Typically used for 1:1 calls but it is used when Google Meet has connectivity issues
GotoMeeting - TS/Sales have a few licenses because of they are engaging with customers
Zoom - A few people in Sales have licences, we are evaluating it for the rest of the team
Lifesize - It's a hardware/software combo that is installed in the conference rooms in the offices
