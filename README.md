# Guidelines

This project:

* Defines and explains the coding style and workflow for the S3 project. See
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

* Provides an `eslint-config-scality` package that can be added as a dependency
  in other projects. That way, coding style can automatically be checked using
  eslint.
